Gammapy is a community-developed, open-source Python package for gamma-ray
astronomy built on Numpy, Scipy and Astropy. **It is the core library for the** `CTAO <https://www.ctao.org/>`__ **Science Tools**
but can also be used to analyse data from existing imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
(IACTs), such as `H.E.S.S. <https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/>`__,
`MAGIC <https://magic.mpp.mpg.de/>`__ and `VERITAS <https://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/>`__. It also provides some support
for `Fermi-LAT <https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`__ and `HAWC <https://www.hawc-observatory.org/>`__ data analysis.

In this webpage you may find a collection of user contributed Jupyter notebooks. These cover a
wide variety of **specific use cases** not present in the `documentation tutorials
<https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/tutorials>`_. Please, read carefully the :ref:`contributing` instructions
if you would like to contribute with your own recipes.
